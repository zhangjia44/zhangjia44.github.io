We further adopt link coding mechanism and interleave operation to enhance the reliability of backscatter signal decoding.

Previous approaches either work in an intrusive manner or fail to capture the micrometer-level vibrations. In this work, we propose mmVib, a practical approach to measure micrometer-level vibrations with mmWave radar. First, we derive a metric called Vibration Signal-to-Noise Ratio (VSNR) that highlights the directions of reducing measurement errors of tiny vibrations. Then, we introduce the design of mmVib based on the concept of Multi-Signal Consolidation (MSC) for the error reduction and multi-object measurement. We implement a prototype of mmVib, and the experiments show that it achieves 3.946% relative amplitude error and 0.02487% relative frequency error in median. Typically, the average amplitude error is only 3.174um when measuring the 100um-amplitude vibration at around 5 meters. Compared to two existing mmWave-based approaches, mmVib reduces the 80th-percentile amplitude error by 69.21% and 97.99% respectively."

        "abstract": "Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is an emerging technique that enables direct communication across different wireless technologies. Recent works achieve physical-level CTC by emulating the standard time-domain waveform of the receiver. This method faces the challenges of inherent unreliability due to the imperfect emulation. Different from analog emulation, we propose a novel concept named digital emulation, which stems from the following insight: The receiver relies on phase shift rather than the phase itself to decode signals. Instead of emulating the original time-domain waveform, the sender emulates the phase shift associated with the desired signals. Clearly there are multiple different phase sequences that correspond to the same signs of phase shifts. Digital emulation has flexibility in setting the phase values in the emulated signals, which is effective in reducing emulation errors and enhancing the reliability of CTC. The key point of digital emulation is generic and applicable to a set of CTCs, where the transmitter has a wider bandwidth for emulation and the receiver decoding is based on the phase shift. In this paper, we implement our proposal as WIDE, a physical-level CTC via digital emulation from WiFi to ZigBee. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of WIDE. The results show that WIDE significantly improves the Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) from 41.7% to 86.2%, which is 2× of WEBee's, an existing representative physical-level CTC."
