3. Search icons from [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) and [academicons]("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jpswalsh/academicons@1/css/academicons.min.css")
4. All info are stored in `./src/content/*.json`, please modify these files.
5. Analytics are hard-coded in `index.html`, make sure to remove them.
6. footer links are hard-coded in `App.vue`
